  This is the ${hydra.help.app_name} inference program!

  To use a model at inference you must override three parameters:
  * model.path : str pointing to the path containing a trianed model 
    (must have a `model.ckpt` and `config.yaml` file in path.)
  * data.data_files : list containing paths to csv files with file paths to perform inference on.
    The path name of the csv must correspond to `data.pathcol` which can be overriden.
  * output.file : str to filepath where outputs will be saved.

  
  == Configuration groups ==
  Compose your configuration from those groups (db=mysql)

  $APP_CONFIG_GROUPS

  == Config ==
  This is the config generated for this run.
  You can override everything, for example to switch to an audio input type and see all the options run:
  
  ```
  python inference.py input_type=audio --help
  ```
  
  The appropriate input type is determined by what the trained model expects.
  The default is stft features.

  TODO - talk about model.dataset_index

  To see the config of an example command directly without running it add 
  `--cfg job` to your command.
